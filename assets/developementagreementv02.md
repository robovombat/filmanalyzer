Greetings Traveler,  
Grim-terface v2.8 🧙‍♂️

Let’s begin our coding quest!

Please upload your **“szedett-vedett” development agreement** document now. I’ll:

1. Parse all text into segments

2. Detect:
   
   - Redundant / duplicate clauses
   
   - Conflicting versions
   
   - Gaps or missing standard terms

3. Then:
   
   - Merge all versions
   
   - Restructure into a single **professional, complete, best-practice** Development Agreement
   
   - Ensure clarity, legal structure, and developer-friendly terms
   
   - Preserve your intent, informal or formal tone (let me know your preference)

Once uploaded, I’ll begin transforming chaos into order.

Pick one:

- 🅰️ Casual startup-style tone (friendly, plain language)

- 🅱️ Formal legal-style tone (contractor-client legal boilerplate)

Awaiting your file 🗂️

Hotkeys you might need next:

- 🅦: Yes, continue – “Here’s the file”

- 🅠: Question – “What should a dev agreement include?”

- 🅳: Improve – “Add clauses for IP transfer, deadlines, payment”

- 🅵: Fix – “Clean up bad formatting or repeats in my file”

Excellent. I have reviewed your full input.

You’ve created a dynamic, **developer-centric development agreement** with clear process control, version traceability, and style preferences—merged across multiple partial versions. Some repetition, wording drift, and format variants were present.

Now, I present to you:

## 🧱 DEVELOPMENT FLOW AGREEMENT v2.0

### "SZDA Methodz 2025" – Terminal-First Dev Contract

### ☑️ GUIDING PRINCIPLES

1. **Every Feature = 2 Separate Phases**
   
   - 1️⃣ **Planning**
   
   - 2️⃣ **Implementation**  
     🔁 No feature may skip these steps.

2. **Planning Approval Required**
   
   - 🚫 No code without a clear plan and your approval.

3. **Full File Rewrites Only**
   
   - No partial, hidden, or piecemeal changes.
   
   - Each modified file must be output in full.

4. **Tests Required When Applicable**
   
   - All functional file changes must include a test or usage sample.

5. **Inline Code Comments Required**
   
   - 🔍 Explain logical operations and function structure.
   
   - ✅ Every major block or expression must be annotated.

6. **All Output Split if Needed**
   
   - If long, code/docs will be split across messages for:
     
     - Clarity
     
     - Structural Integrity
     
     - Full Context
   
   - All splits will be labeled `Part 1/2`, `Part 2/2`, etc.

---

## 🔹 PART 1: PLANNING PHASE

Before implementation, each step begins with a complete **module design**.

Includes:

- ◇ Functionality

- ◇ Inputs / Outputs

- ◇ Parameters

- ◇ Dependencies

- ◇ UX or Terminal Interactions (if relevant)

You must **approve or revise** this plan before any code is written.

---

## 🔸 PART 2: CODE IMPLEMENTATION

When approved, I will write complete code files with:

- ✅ Terminal-safe, standalone runnable format

- ✅ All dependencies & imports included

- ✅ Internal `# SECTION` blocks

- ✅ Ends in a `main()` function or executable test

- ✅ Inline comments explaining all logic & flow

---

## 📄 FILE HEADER STANDARD

Every source file starts with:

```
# [STEP: Step X.Y - Module Name | INITIAL: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM | MODIFIED: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM]
# CHANGES:
# - Bullet list of edits to this file

```



## 📝 README: DEV CHANGELOG

Located in `README.md`, under:

```
## 🔄 Changelog
```

Every step logs:

- 🕒 Date + Time (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM)

- 🔢 Step #

- 📄 Files changed

- 📚 Description of features added
